      Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi
      mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use
      in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.
      
      This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character
      repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not
      recommended for normal use). A few Arabic script characters that were added
      to Unicode 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 have also been included. Font smarts are implemented using Graphite
      technology.
      
      This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font technologies,
      including variant glyphs for a number of characters for use in particular
      contexts.
      
      This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic
      connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures
      or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This
      simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic
      languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and
      literate communities.
      
      Two fonts from this typeface family are included:
      
      * Lateef Regular
      * Lateef Bold
      
      The Latin glyphs in this font are from the Crimson Pro font family
      (https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro).
      
      For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
