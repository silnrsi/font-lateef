FONTLOG 
Lateef font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Lateef font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Lateef fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi 
mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use 
in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use). A few Arabic script characters that were added 
to Unicode 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 have also been included. Font smarts are implemented using Graphite 
technology.

This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font technologies, 
including variant glyphs for a number of characters for use in particular 
contexts. 

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

Two fonts from this typeface family are included:

     * Lateef Regular
     * Lateef Bold

The Latin glyphs in this font are from the Crimson Pro font family 
(https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro).

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Lateef" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Lateef. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants 
through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as 
long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Lateef" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Lateef SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Lateef" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Nations Naskh".

Known Issues (v 1.280 alpha)
----------------------------
- Combining marks above or below composite characters may not position correctly 
  (e.g. If a character has nuktas above, the combining mark above may not position 
  properly. If a character has nuktas below, the combining mark BELOW may not 
  position properly.)
- When text is kashida-justified in Word, the lam/alef ligature may break
- This version of the font does not have kerning (where characters may touch each 
  other), so there is no need to report when a reh touches the following character, etc.
- This version of the font has not had the linespacing values evaluated, so there is 
  no need to report vertical linespacing issues.
