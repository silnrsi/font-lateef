DOCUMENTATION
Lateef
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

FYI: There is a problem with language features for kir/ky and wol/wo in features.md. 
Our pdf maker requires the 3 letter codes and html requires 2 letter codes. It is best
to open the .html file and create a pdf manually. It might be better to do this for
each document that uses the font: allah.html, features.html, sample.html.

There is also an issue with the product site generation of the tag for tnum and pnum 
in features.md document. These tags need adding:
[font id='lateefL-pnum-1' face='Lateef-Regular' bold='Lateef-Bold' size='160%' ltr=1 feats='pnum 1']
[font id='lateefL-tnum-1' face='Lateef-Regular' bold='Lateef-Bold' size='160%' ltr=1 feats='tnum 1']
