#### Known issues

- Characters added since LateefGR are not yet kerned so spacing after reh- and waw-like characters may be incorrect. Please let us know of specific combinations that should be improved.
- In Word: kerning of Arabic proportional digits is incorrect. This is a bug in Word.
- In InDesign: some behaviors, such as the _lam-alef_ ligature, raised _kasra_ with _shadda_, and subtending marks, will not function correctly unless **Ligatures** is turned on in the **Characters** panel.
