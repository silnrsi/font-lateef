Lateef provides a “simplified” rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages.

Six fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Lateef* release:

* Lateef Light Regular
* Lateef Light Bold
* Lateef Regular
* Lateef Bold
* Lateef Book Regular
* Lateef Book Bold



## Type Samples

Type samples showing some of the inventory of glyphs can be found here: 
[Lateef Type Sample](sample).

An example of some text is shown below.
