fontversion: 2.000
---

Lateef provides a &#x201c;simplified&#x201d; rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages.

Six fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Lateef* release:

- Lateef Light Regular
- Lateef Light Bold
- Lateef Regular
- Lateef Bold
- Lateef Book Regular
- Lateef Book Bold



## Type Samples

Type samples showing some of the inventory of glyphs can be found here: 
[Lateef Type Sample](sample.md).
