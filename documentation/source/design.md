title: Lateef - Design
fontversion: 4.200
---

Lateef provides a &#x201c;simplified&#x201d; rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages.

Seven weights for this typeface family are included:

- Lateef ExtraLight
- Lateef Light
- Lateef Regular
- Lateef Medium
- Lateef SemiBold
- Lateef Bold
- Lateef ExtraBold
