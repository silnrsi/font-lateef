    <ul>
    <li>Repackage fonts so there is one axis-based Lateef family rather than three RIBBI families</li>
    <li>Reverted default linespacing to that of Lateef 1.001 which was much tighter than LateefGR</li>
    <li>Reverted kerning to that of LateefGR. Characters added since LateefGR are not yet kerned.</li>
    <li>TypeTuner line spacing options now include
    <ul>

    <li>"Extra Loose" equivalent to LateefGR Loose setting</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li>pnum - access proportional versions of Latin digits</li>

    <li>Adjusted width of various whitespace characters to conform to best practice</li>
    <li>Updated Allah ligature rules</li>

    <h4 id="known-issues">Known issues</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Characters added since LateefGR are not yet kerned so spacing after reh- and waw-like characters may be incorrect. Please let us know of specific combinations that should be improved.</li>
    <li>In Word, kerning of Arabic proportional digits is incorrect. This is a bug in Word.</li>
    </ul>
