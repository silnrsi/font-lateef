A generic FAQ for all of our Arabic scripts fonts can be found here: [Arabic Fonts - FAQ](http://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/faq/). FAQ's specific to Lateef are found below.

#### *What are the differences between the **Lateef** and **LateefGR** fonts?*

The most obvious difference is that **Lateef** only provides OpenType support and **LateefGR** only provides Graphite support. For a complete list of the differences, you can read the [Release 1.200 announcement](http://software.sil.org/lateef/release-1-200/). 

This _beta_ version of **Lateef** is an OpenType font that includes all the kerning support that is currently only found in **LateefGR**. It also includes many more characters than were in **LateefGR**. 

#### *What characters are included with this release?*

See [Character Set Support](charset.md) for the full listing.

#### *I notice that Lateef is missing a number of characters that I would like. Will you add these?*

It is impossible for us to add every glyph that every person desires, but we do place a high priority on adding complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). You can send us your requests, but please understand that we are unlikely to add symbols where the user base is very small, unless they have been accepted into Unicode.


#### *What is so special about Lateef?*

Lateef is designed in an appropriate style often used for Sindhi and other languages of southern Asia. This font is designed to work with the OpenType font technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages. See [Smart Font Features](features.md).

#### *What makes Lateef specifically "Sindhi-style"?*

* The lam-alef ligature is designed in a Sindhi-style: ![Lateef lam-alef ligature](assets/images/LateefLamAlef.jpg){.fullsize}
