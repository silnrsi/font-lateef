## Changes

#### New

- Added:
    - FD42 ARABIC LIGATURE RADI ALLAAHU ANHAA
    - FD47 ARABIC LIGATURE ALAYHI AS-SALAAM
    - FDCF ARABIC LIGATURE SALAAMUHU ALAYNAA

#### Known issues
- Shaping for the newly added characters may not yet occur in applications.
- Medial and final high hamza characters may have collisions (these likely do not occur).
- Lam + high hamza alef ligature does not form as it likely does not occur.
- In Word: kerning of Arabic proportional digits is incorrect. This is a bug in Word.
- In InDesign: some behaviors, such as the _lam-alef_ ligature, raised _kasra_ with _shadda_, and subtending marks, will not function correctly unless **Ligatures** is turned on in the **Characters** panel.
