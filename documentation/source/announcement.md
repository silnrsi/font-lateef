#### Changes

2022-05-16 (SIL WSTech team) Lateef Version 1.400 (beta release)

- Repackage fonts so there is a single Lateef family (containing seven weights) rather than three families, each having two weights (Regular, Bold)
- Adjusted default linespacing to match that of Lateef 1.001 (which is tighter than LateefGR)
- Adjusted kerning to be similar to that of LateefGR
- Refined size and positioning of digits used with subtending marks
- New features:
     - cv85 - alternate for decimal separator
     - tnum - access tabular versions of Arabic digits
     - pnum - access proportional versions of Latin digits
- Latin digits are now tabular; use new "pnum" feature to access proportional digits
- Added kerning for proportional Arabic digits
- Adjusted width of various whitespace characters to conform to best practice
- Updated Allah ligature rules
- Added Arabic-style (rounded) versions of chevron quotes

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download Page](https://software.sil.org/lateef/download/).

#### Known issues

- Characters added since LateefGR are not yet kerned so spacing after reh- and waw-like characters may be incorrect. Please let us know of specific combinations that should be improved.
- In Word, kerning of Arabic proportional digits is incorrect. This is a bug in Word.
